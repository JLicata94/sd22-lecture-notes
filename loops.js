//Loops

/*
*Allow us to go over a block of code a determined amount of cycles.Its important to that it is posasible for us to write code without declarind an endpoint.

* Loops allow us to repeat a process without rewritng a lot of code.
*/

/*
*executed a statement inside a code block provided that it is true.

* The condtion is evaluted before executing the statement.

// For Loops

/*
* We have to setup our loop in a way where we can:
*see where we are in a loop
*consider the condition we run it against
*note when we are done with that condtion
